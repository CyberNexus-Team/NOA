### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own instance of NOA up and running.

#### Prerequisites
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.
*   A Google account (for Google Drive & Gmail integration).
*   API keys from the services you intend to use.

#### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CyberNexus-Team/NOA.git
    cd NOA
    ```

2.  **Start the services using Docker Compose:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This command will start both the n8n container and the local web interface.

3.  **Set up n8n:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate.
    *   Set up your n8n owner account.
    *   Import the provided workflow file (`workflow.json`) into n8n.

4.  **Configure API Keys & Credentials:**
    *   To get your API keys, we've compiled a list of direct registration links for all supported services. You can find it in our **[API_KEYS.md](API_KEYS.md)** document.
    *   Once you have your keys, open the n8n interface, navigate to the "Credentials" section in the left sidebar, and add new credentials for each service (e.g., Shodan, Google, etc.).

### Usage

1.  Open the local web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:[PORTA_INTERFACCIA_WEB]`.
2.  Enter your search query (e.g., a domain, an email, a username).
3.  Submit the form. The interface will trigger the n8n workflow.
4.  Wait for the process to complete.
5.  Check your configured Google Drive folder and email inbox for the automatically generated report.
